#EatSafe

##EatSafe addresses two problems:


###1) Food inspection ratings are publicly available, but not easily linked with restaurants.
The Chicago Open Data website is not a destination for most casual restaurant-goers.
 We hope to give people this information for them to use responsibly.

###2) Food inspection ratings are difficult to interpret.
Chicago has received criticism in the past for using a "Pass/Fail" inspection scheme rather
than the letter grade rating that other major cities like New York and Los
Angeles uses [1]. They are also hard to interpret individually, since
taken on their own, they may be more reflective of that particular inspector,
or of circumstance [2] (chief example: a restaurant failed an inspection for
storing food at too high temperatures after their power went out).


##Our solution:
Our solution is to create a metric that aggregates a restaurant's
inspection ratings over time, and presents that in a clear and accessible 
format for the public (an iOS app). Even if a particular restaurant failed
one health inspection for unfair reasons, we assume that over the span of its
history, the inspections average out to be indicative of the restaurant's
quality.

(Note: If you have any information that might suggest that inspectors might
be systematically biased, contact us and we can attempt some deeper analyses)
